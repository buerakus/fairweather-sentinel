# Fairweather Sentinel

**Fairweather Sentinel** is a lightweight, standalone Python-based vulnerability assessment tool designed to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) identify security risks in their IT infrastructure. It scans systems and networks for known vulnerabilities, prioritizes risks, and provides actionable security recommendations without requiring deep technical expertise.

## 📌 Project Overview

In an era of increasing cyber threats, many organizations — particularly SMEs — lack the resources and expertise to perform regular security assessments. Fairweather Sentinel bridges this gap by offering a cost-effective, user-friendly solution that enables proactive cybersecurity management through automated vulnerability scanning and risk evaluation.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Automated vulnerability scanning** across devices and networks.
- 📊 **Severity-based risk classification** using CVE/NVD databases.
- 📄 **Structured security reports** for technical and non-technical users.
- 📅 **Manual and scheduled scans** for continuous security monitoring.
- 🧭 **Step-by-step mitigation recommendations** for each detected vulnerability.
- 👥 **Role-based interface** for IT experts, business owners, and non-technical staff.

## ❌ Limitations

- No real-time threat detection (IDS/IPS not included).
- No automated patching or remediation.
- No penetration testing features.
- Not a replacement for antivirus, firewalls, or SIEM tools — designed to complement them.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Tkinter** for GUI (if applicable)
- **SQLite** (optional for storing scan data)
- **Nmap** or custom socket scanning modules
- **API Integration** with CVE/NVD databases
