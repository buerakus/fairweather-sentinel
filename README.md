# Fairweather Sentinel

Fairweather Sentinel is a lightweight, standalone Python-based vulnerability assessment tool designed to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) identify security risks in their IT infrastructure. It scans systems and networks for known vulnerabilities, prioritizes risks, and provides actionable security recommendations without requiring deep technical expertise.
